/**
 * useAuthAction
 * The "busy / error" bookkeeping the log-in, recovery and new-password forms
 * share, so each form only has to say WHAT to call and WHAT to show if the
 * server says no.
 *
 *   const { busy, error, setError, run } = useAuthAction();
 *   run(() => onSubmit(values), "Wrong email or password");
 *
 * run() does three things:
 *   1. sets `busy` while the call is in flight (forms disable their buttons)
 *   2. if the SERVER answered with an error (401, 400, …) → shows a message.
 *      `failureMessage` is usually a fixed string, but can be a function
 *      `(err) => string` when the wording depends on which error came back —
 *      e.g. LoginForm shows different text for "wrong password" (401) than
 *      for "never verified your email" (403).
 *   3. if there was NO answer at all (backend not running, no network) → shows
 *      NETWORK_MESSAGE instead, so "the server is down" never gets mistaken
 *      for "wrong password" while the backend is still being built
