 * upload
 * Multer instance used on any route that accepts photo files (sign-up's
 * photo step, and POST /api/profile/photos). Buffers files in memory rather
 * than writing them straight to disk, so a request that fails validation
 * elsewhere (e.g. sign-up's other fields) never leaves orphaned files behind
 * — see utils/photoStorage.js, which is what actually commits buffers to
 * backend/uploads/ once a request is known to be good.
 *
 * 🎛️ MAX_FILE_BYTES / MAX_FILES — raise these if 5MB or 10 photos per
 * request feels too tight for real phone photos.
